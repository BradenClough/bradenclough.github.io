<h2>Scatterplots</h2>
<p>Scatterplots are a way of visualizing collections of data without a line. Each point on a scatterplot is an individual data entry. In the shown plot, one can see every entry of how a plant's height changes as tempurature increases. This particular plot shows the user how the plants are more prone to being taller as tempurature increases.</p>

<h3>Line of Best Fit</h3>
<p>The line of best fit is a way of showing the relation between points on a scatter plot. It serves the purpose of estimating how the y value of the graph changes in proportion to the x axis. It is expressed as the formula y = mx+b. The y value is calculated by mulitplying the x value by the slope (m) then adding the y intercept (b). When the code runs, you can see it print the forumla each input's line of best fit, starting with the phrase "The line of best fit is"</p>
